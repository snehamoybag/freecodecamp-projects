Here is a list of projects I've worked on while learning from freeCodeCamp.org .

I am on the 'self-learn' path to become a Frontend Developer. The journey has been quite challenging as I come from a non-IT background with zero coding knowledge beforehand. Few months back, I had no Idea where to even start to begin with.

But today thanks to freeCodeCamp's coding curriculum and Internet's endless information, I finally know where to start and where to finish!
